#problem1 - adapted from p8104 course

Write a function that, for a fixed group size, randomly draws “birthdays” for each person; checks whether there are duplicate birthdays in the group; and returns TRUE or FALSE based on the result.


```{r}
b_day_func = function(group_size) {
  #random birthday generation for each group
  sim_b_data = tibble(
    b_days = sample(1:365, group_size, replace=TRUE))
  
  any(duplicated(sim_b_data$b_days)) #check - one output 
}

b_day_func(1)
b_day_func(5)
b_day_func(10)

```

Next, run this function 10000 times for each group size between 2 and 50. For each group size, compute the probability that at least two people in the group will share a birthday by averaging across the 10000 simulation runs. Make a plot showing the probability as a function of group size, and comment on your results.

```{r}
group_sizes = seq(2,50)
iter = 1:10000

sim_results_df_p1 = 
  expand_grid(
    group_sizes = seq(2,50),
    iter = 1:10000
  ) |>
  mutate(result)

```
